                     <p class="page-plain-text">The NFT-DAO is committed to building infrastructure components that improve the use of NFTs on Cardano and deploy easy solutions for the community. <br/><br/>We see EZ-Onâ€”Interop NFTs, as an integral part of making the Cardano ecosystem more user-friendly.</p>
                     <p class="page-subtitle">GUIDING QUESTIONS</p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle-darker"> What are the the tools that we need to prioritize first</span> <br/> Our model centers on a NFT Framework of composable parts that continue to add functionality and ease the developer and user experience. Weighing that against the development cycles required to produce the components, this research project informs our next steps toward interoperable NFTs.<br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker"> How do we attract developers from outside of our current community to participate in Catalyst?</span> <br/>Creating interoperability across chains and ecosystems is one way.<br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker"> What do developers want, and how do they get it from the Cardano dev ecosystem?</span> <br/>Developers want tools and approaches that make their lives simpler. They also want clear documentation to ensure they can implement new things without too much trouble. They also want things to work they way they are intended. This project will start small and grow over time with the direction the research takes us.<br/><span class="page-subtitle-darker"> What would make a developer motivated to grind through the docs and code no matter how hard it is to create an app?</span><br/> It has to be well worth the trouble. So rather than fight that, we aim to make it easier, faster and more fun with this project.<br><br/><span class="page-subtitle-darker"> What are enterprise dev managers looking for in order to be able to build out enterprise projects</span><br/> - either internal or commercial? Wether internal or commercial, the enterprise has a high standard of security, compliance, documentation, support, packaging and dev/ops. That is why interoperability makes more sense than any other implementation.</p>
                     <p class="page-subtitle">WHO WILL DELIVER THIS SOLUTION?</p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle-darker">TEAM MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE</span><br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">FranÃ§ois-RenÃ© "FarÃ©" Rideau</span>  - CEO++,++ Co-Founder, has been making programming languages and distributed systems usable for 25 years.
