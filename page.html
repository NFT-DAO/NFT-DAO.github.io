                <p class="page-plain-text-but-lighter">Glow is a programming language used to make decentralized applications, otherwise known as DApps. Its design goals are:<br/><br/> <span class="highlighted-text">Safety:</span> each newly implemented function is thoroughly audited so that a programmer using the Glow language or its associated toolset won't have to worry about securing interactions between users. <br/><br/> <span class="highlighted-text">User-friendliness:</span> we want to make DApps mainstream, and Glow's development team always aims at making it obvious what a DApp does or doesn't do, so users can ascertain that it indeed matches their expectations.<br/><br/> <span class="highlighted-text">Portability to any blockchain:</span> applications written in Glow can run on any blockchain, so unlike with previous tools, you don't have to learn all the tooling specific to a single blockchain only to realize later the users you want will be on another blockchain. The same DApp will be able to use the resources of multiple blockchains at once, and meet the users where they are and wherever they will be.<br/><br/> In other words: what usually takes a huge amount of lines of code, and many experts in various fields, has been automated and abstracted by Glow. <br/><br/>We at NFT-DAO will leverage the experience of the Glow team to help us build the right tools for the NFT developers we seek to build the ecosystem to support.</p>
                <p class="page-subtitle">EZ-On Ecosystem Development</p>
                <p class="page-plain-text"> <span class="highlighted-text">Vision</span> <br/><br/>The fastest way to get from ETH to Cardano!! NFT projects on ETH want to quickly bring their dApps to the Cardano blockchain as well. The ERC20 and ERC721 token converters enable some of the work. Refactoring other system components can be achieved by building tools and composable building blocks to help the transition. <br/><br/><span class="highlighted-text">What We'll Do</span> <br/><br/>We intend to build the developer ecosystem tools, libraries, and contracts necessary to handle 80% of the most common use cases that are needed for smoothly transitioning ETH NFT projects and other ETH dApps. <br/><br/><span class="highlighted-text">Who Will Help Us</span> <br/><br/>We will do this with partners like IOG professional Services and MuKn.io then plan to open source the things we are able in order to encourage the good ETH NFT projects to feel welcome on Cardano. <br/><br/>MuKn created Glow, a language that makes it tremendously easier to write, and verify, DApps—a "JavaScript for Blockchain", a market-disrupting product. We will work with MuKn to build the components developers want. <br/><br/><span class="highlighted-text">Stretch Goals</span><br/><br/>Additionally, we intend to provide tools for Java developers who represent 40.2% of programmers whereas Haskell represent 2.1%. Providing easy on-boarding (EZ-on) for these Ocean programmers is a longer term goal, this will extend into Fund-5 realistically, but if we can get started in Fund 4 we will!</p>

Alumnus of the École Normale Supérieure, Former Senior Engineer at ITA Software, he also worked at Google and Bridgewater Associates. While working in the industry, he notably maintained and rewrote ASDF, the build system at the heart of the Common Lisp open source community; he also kept publishing academic papers and speaking at programming language conferences; early in his career, he even proved in Coq the correctness of a (centralized) payment protocol. Eventually, his interests in economics and software security converged with his experience in open source software and formal methods and he started working on Layer 2 solutions for the Blockchain.

                <p class="page-subtitle mt-5">OUR ETHOS AND PURPOSE</p>
                <p class="page-plain-text">NFT-DAO is a community originating inside the Cardano Catalyst community with our primary focus and the purpose of supporting NFTs. We're an emergent DAO in formation inside the Catalyst DAO and an NFT bridge to others outside of Catalyst and Cardano at large. We aspire to:<br/><br/> * Holonic architecture <br/>* Heterarchical communication <br/>* Autonomous Cooperative behavior <br/>* Chaordic systems thinking<br/><br/> Our structure is currently emerging as the embodiment of purpose, principles, people, and concept is being captured in a written document capable of creating legal reality in an appropriate jurisdiction (a Wyoming DAO), in the form of a charter and constitution or a certificate of incorporation and bylaws. It is the written, structural details of the conceptual relationships — details of eligibility, ownership, voting, bodies, and methods of governance. It is the contract of rights and obligations between all participants in the community.</p>
                <p class="page-subtitle mt-5">MULTI-CURRENCY LEDGER</p>
                <p class="page-plain-text">NFTs are our primary focus and purpose. The introduction of a multi-currency ledger model into Cardano allows the network to support additional cryptocurrencies in an ERC20-like way, but cheaply, more securely, and without the need for a complex scripting system thanks to native support in the settlement layer. Not only are users able to create their own fungible tokens on the Cardano network, but a multi-currency ledger also allows for tokenization with the creation of non-fungible tokens, plus easier integration with smart contracts involving multiple cryptocurrencies.</p>
                <p class="page-subtitle mt-5">SMART CONTRACTS</p>
                <p class="page-plain-text">Supporting our focus and purpose on non-fungible tokens, the integration of smart contracts, the Goguen era represents a big step forward in capability for the Cardano network. Where the Shelley era decentralizes the core of the system, Goguen adds the ability to build decentralized applications (DApps) on Cardano's solid foundation of peer-reviewed research and high-assurance development. <br/><br/>The work for Goguen has been under way in parallel with Shelley, and when complete will allow users from technical and non-technical backgrounds to create and execute functional smart contracts on the Cardano network. One of the goals for the Goguen era has been the creation of Plutus, a purpose-built smart contract development language and execution platform using the functional programming language Haskell. Plutus is already available for testing and brings the benefits of functional programming to smart contract creation. It also allows one code base to support both on and off-chain components, improving the coherency and usability of the development experience compared with existing smart contract implementations. <br/><br/>The Goguen era also encompasses work to make Cardano accessible to wider audiences via Marlowe, allowing financial and business experts with no previous technical knowledge to create smart contracts. Marlowe is a high-level, domain-specific language (DSL) for financial contracts which is built on Plutus. Marlowe comes with the Marlowe Playground, an easy-to-use application-building platform that non-programmers can use to build financial smart contracts. Together, Marlowe and the Marlowe Playground simplify the process of creating smart contracts for financial applications, allowing subject matter experts to directly contribute without requiring deep programming skills. The combination of Plutus and Marlowe will enable a new class of enterprise-level smart contracts with verified functionality, capable of underpinning large scale implementations in the real world. <br/><br/>As well as adding functionality in the form of smart contracts, Goguen will also see improvements to the core Cardano offering. Most significantly, the addition of a multi-currency ledger will extend the usefulness of Cardano even further, enabling users to create new natively-supported tokens. This will allow the creation of fungible and non-fungible tokens, supporting the creation of new cryptocurrencies on Cardano as well as the tokenization of many types of digital and physical assets. Another benefit will be easier integration of smart contracts and DApps involving multiple cryptocurrencies. The Goguen era represents a step change in the abilities of Cardano, opening the way to the development of enterprise-level, mission-critical, decentralized smart contract applications, with even more exciting things to come during the Basho and Voltaire eras. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading this far, we appreciate your feedback, kudos and votes! <br/><br/>The NFT-DAO collective</p>
