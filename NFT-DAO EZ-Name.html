                    <p class="page-plain-text-but-lighter">
                     Our model centers on a NFT Framework of composable parts that continue to add functionality and ease the developer and user experience. Weighing that against the development cycles required to produce the components, this research project informs our next steps toward interoperable NFTs.

                    </p>
                    <p class="page-plain-text-but-lighter">
                     Developers want tools and approaches that make their lives simpler. They also want clear documentation to ensure they can implement new things without too much trouble. They also want things to work they way they are intended. This project will start small and grow over time with the direction the research takes us.
                  </p>
                    <p class="page-subtitle">What would make a developer motivated to grind through the docs and code no matter how hard it is to create an app?

                     It has to be well worth the trouble. So rather than fight that, we aim to make it easier, faster and more fun with this project.

                    <p class="page-plain-text-but-lighter">
                     Wether internal or commercial, the enterprise has a high standard of security, compliance, documentation, support, packaging and dev/ops. That is why interoperability makes more sense than any other implementation.</p>

                        While working in the industry, he notably maintained and rewrote ASDF, the build system at the heart of the Common Lisp open source community; he also kept publishing academic papers and speaking at programming language conferences; early in his career, he even proved in Coq the correctness of a (centralized) payment protocol.
                        Eventually, his interests in economics and software security converged with his experience in open source software and formal methods and he started working on Layer 2 solutions for the Blockchain. Since January 2018, he has made plenty of mistakes as co-founder of startups, and learned the hard way to become his own CEO.  </p>

They are eager to build their business model on top of a solid framework. Since none has existed for Cardano, they were planning to build one for themselves from scratch. They are one of ~300 individuals who could potentially pool their expertise into an all-embracing open-source version to benefit the entire community rather than one project. Their expertise is multivariate in development, SPO, marketing, design, business, and more.
