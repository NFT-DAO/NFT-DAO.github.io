                     <p class="page-plain-text">The NFT-DAO is committed to building infrastructure components that improve the use of NFTs on Cardano and deploy easy solutions for the community. <br/><br/>We see EZ-On—Interop NFTs, as an integral part of making the Cardano ecosystem more user-friendly.</p>
                     <p class="page-subtitle">GUIDING QUESTIONS</p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle-darker"> What are the the tools that we need to prioritize first</span> <br/> Our model centers on a NFT Framework of composable parts that continue to add functionality and ease the developer and user experience. Weighing that against the development cycles required to produce the components, this research project informs our next steps toward interoperable NFTs.<br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker"> How do we attract developers from outside of our current community to participate in Catalyst?</span> <br/>Creating interoperability across chains and ecosystems is one way.<br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker"> What do developers want, and how do they get it from the Cardano dev ecosystem?</span> <br/>Developers want tools and approaches that make their lives simpler. They also want clear documentation to ensure they can implement new things without too much trouble. They also want things to work they way they are intended. This project will start small and grow over time with the direction the research takes us.<br/><span class="page-subtitle-darker"> What would make a developer motivated to grind through the docs and code no matter how hard it is to create an app?</span><br/> It has to be well worth the trouble. So rather than fight that, we aim to make it easier, faster and more fun with this project.<br><br/><span class="page-subtitle-darker"> What are enterprise dev managers looking for in order to be able to build out enterprise projects</span><br/> - either internal or commercial? Wether internal or commercial, the enterprise has a high standard of security, compliance, documentation, support, packaging and dev/ops. That is why interoperability makes more sense than any other implementation.</p>
                     <p class="page-subtitle">WHO WILL DELIVER THIS SOLUTION?</p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle-darker">TEAM MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE</span><br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">François-René "Faré" Rideau</span>  - CEO++,++ Co-Founder, has been making programming languages and distributed systems usable for 25 years. Alumnus of the École Normale Supérieure, Former Senior Engineer at ITA Software, he also worked at Google and Bridgewater Associates.<br/><br/> While working in the industry, he notably maintained and rewrote ASDF, the build system at the heart of the Common Lisp open source community; he also kept publishing academic papers and speaking at programming language conferences; early in his career, he even proved in Coq the correctness of a (centralized) payment protocol.<br/><br/> Eventually, his interests in economics and software security converged with his experience in open source software and formal methods and he started working on Layer 2 solutions for the Blockchain. Since January 2018, he has made plenty of mistakes as co-founder of startups, and learned the hard way to become his own CEO.<br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker"> Alexander Smart</span> - Chief Operations Officier, Co-Founder, has always thought fast, but learned to think deep and sharp at UChicago. After studying law at Pepperdine, he spent nearly fifteen years guiding executives and decision makers through litigation, in matters ranging from shoplifting and speeding tickets to multi-forum international investment bank disputes.<br/><br/> His practice honed his ability to quickly assimilate and master new information, and deliver that information clearly at any level of sophistication. Tiring of courthouses, he found his skills were readily applicable and desperately needed in the blockchain space.<br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">Gauthier Lamothe</span> - Chief Communications Officer, Co-Founder, has been a seasoned coach, psychotherapist and instructor in communication and management.<br/><br/> He doubled his career as a media expert (film and software producer, then e-marketing manager). <br/><br/>He participated in the development of a few blockchains, for entities such as the Free Republic of Liberland, and worked on decentralized justice systems, tokenization of governance, and of course crypto-currencies.<br/><br/> His work in the MuKn ecosystem is to take care of every aspect related to communications and human issues, both within the company and with customers and partners, for awareness of human-related safety risks are often dramatically underestimated in the blockchain space.<br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker"> Alexander Knauth</span> - Developer, Alexander studied at Northeastern University College of Computer and Information Science and achieved a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, where he researched Type Systems and Macros.<br/><br/> Co-author of two research papers at POPL, he also contributed to the Racket programming language.<br/><br/> Currently working for Mutual Knowledge Systems Inc. after a first collaboration on another project for Alacris/Legilogic <br/><br/><span class="page-subtitle-darker"> Drew Crampsie</span> - Developer, Drew is an independent systems developer with over 20 years of experience in designing, implementing and maintaining Internet based applications and servers with a focus on "bleeding edge" Web Apps. <br/><br/>Drew is a seasoned user in non-mainstream and mainstream techs and languages (Scheme, Common Lisp, SQL, Javascript, C…). <br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker"> Emeka Nwanko</span> - Developer, After graduating in 2005 from Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Emeka Nwanko worked for several companies as a Field Engineer or Operations Manager, such as Schlumberger Nigeria or Northern Oilfield Services and Supplies.<br/><br/> He also worked for Satajanus Nigeria Limited as a software developer in the field of Blockchain industry, both in C# and F#, but also in Rust and Solidity.<br/><br/>  He also offers free programming classes as a teacher.</p>
