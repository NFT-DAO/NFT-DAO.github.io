                     <p class="page-plain-text"> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">How?</span> <br/> Build an API that connects to many diverse payment systems and types. <br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">Why?</span> <br/> * APIs abstract a lot of work away from the developer, bringing them peace of mind and a delightful experience. <br/><br/> * Payment systems and wallet connectors add significant developer time to projects when custom built over and over.<br/> <br/> * A tried and tested API connector saves project costs, code errors, debugging time, and a host of labor and aggravation. <br/><br/> * An API can continue to add new services underneath, expanding the utility, without requiring DApps to be refactored.</p>
                    
                     <p class="page-plain-text"> <span class="page-subtitle">PROJECT SCOPE</span><br/>* Create an API that utilizes multiple payment methods and wallet types and can easily connect to DApps like the NFT Framework and others.<br/> <br/>  - Create clear API documentation using SlateDocs or similar. <br/> <br/> * Create an SDK to supply any components a developer might find necessary when creating new applications for the API product and its ecosystem. <br/> <br/> - Include code samples, which give developers example programs and libraries to help them learn how to build basic programs. <br/> <br/> * Rigorously test for security, attack vectors and cryptographic efficacy. <br/> <br/> - Glow has built-in support for formal methods to automate the verification of security properties.</p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle">BENEFITS</span><br/> Developers benefit with an API solution for all things related to payments.<br/> <br/>  Users benefit from ease-of-use payment tracking and reporting functionality built into the EZ-Pay DApp.<br/> <br/>  The Cardano ecosystem expands it's ability to build great technology quickly with the addition of this component.<br/> <br/>  NFT Marketplaces, our target benefactor, get a really great user experience from this API and DApp.<br/> <br/>  Happy developers telling their buddies to come build on Cardano!</p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle">SCHEDULE</span><br/> General Availability (GA) of MVP is approximately 6-months from start date.<br/><br/> Fully Operational (FO) is approximately 9-months from start date. This is a project that is very much needed and fully inline with the concept of this challenge asking: How can we create a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful apps? A great API for an often used component is exactly what this EZ-Pay API is.</p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle">BACKGROUND</span><br/> The NFT-DAO is committed to building infrastructure components that improve the use of NFTs on Cardano and deploy easy solutions for the community. <br/> <br/> We see EZ-On—Interop NFTs, as an integral part of making the Cardano ecosystem more user-friendly.</p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle">PLAN AND BUDGET</span><br/>Utilizing Glow Language and the MuKn team's expertise, we will start building integrations to selected payment methods. First we will be researching the specific candidates. The goal of EZ-On API is developers can simply use it to connect to payment options. We will of course build this into the NFT Framework for all marketplaces to use.<br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">Phase 1</span> <br/>  - Research the payment systems we will connect with, like wallets, Visa, Paypal, Venmo etc. <br/><br/>- Market testing developers for their wish list <br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">Phase 2</span> <br/> - Prioritize Resource Utilization <br/><br/>- Assign teams and workload <br/><br/>- Mutual Knowledge will handle the development <br/><br/>- NFT-DAO will handle the commercialization (requirements, website, market research, partnerships, operations)<br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">Phase 3 </span><br/> - Run Sprints to build components needed<br/><br/> - Document API as development occurs <br/><br/>- Start on SDK<br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">Phase 4 </span><br/> - Testing, Audit and hardening (dev/ops teams doing verification testing) <br/><br/>- Complete API documents <br/><br/>- Firm up the SDK<br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">Phase 5 </span><br/> - Go Live (alpha and beta testing in real world conditions)<br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">Phase 6</span> <br/> - G/A Launch (General Availability for developers to use)<br/><br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">Total: </span> $69, 945# <br/><br/> # Includes contract development, marketing and operational estimates allowing for a 12-month launch cycle.</p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle">DEFINED SUCCESS REPORTING</span><br/>3-month: Post funding much of this work will be available to see firsthand and can be followed in the Github repository. The system will be taking shape and the first simple connectors should be operational in MVP and beta mode. <br/> <br/> 6-month: The MVP API will be active in General Availability (GA) and Fully Operational (FO).<br/> <br/>  12-month: Many additional payment services will be available and the API and SDK v1.0 fully in use. (we can't say until we do the research exactly how many services will be available in 12-months, but our goal is to move as quickly as we can). </p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle">BACKGROUND</span><br/><span class="page-subtitle-darker">EZ-Pay API</span><br/>The EZ-Pay API will allow developers to access the full functionality of EZ-Pay. Some example API methods we are planning include sending invoices, accepting payments, managing subscription billing, and editing and managing account information. EZ-Pay is a service that allows users to accept payments online, specifically developers. With the EZ-Pay application, users can keep track of payments, search past payments, create recurring charges, and keep track of customers. We want to bring similar use models common to Web2.0 internet e-commerce over to Web3.0 blockchains. This is not an easy feat, so we need your support!<br/> <br/>  In our winning Fund 3 proposal for an "NFT Framework", we promised to add connectors, extensions and enhancements. This EZ-Pay API is one of those tools developers need and want. An easy-to-use payment solution. NFT Marketplaces who use the NFT Framework will be delighted to have this easy way to accept payments for NFT auctions and sales.<br/> <br/>  One line of code is the promise of Stripe (a payment API—Application Program Interface). While we wish Stripe was that simple, we know it's a lot simpler than Web3 blockchain technology is now. We want to change that!<br/> <br/>  Our goal with the EZ-On Tech Suite of solutions is making it easy to onboard all developers, but especially those coming over from the Ethereum blockchain in this proposal.<br/> <br/>  Let's make wallets and payments on Cardano as simple as one line of code to connect and use in any DApp through an API that delights developers.</p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle">BRIDGING DIGITAL AND FIAT</span><br/><span class="page-subtitle-darker">VISA</span><br/>In March 2021: Visa has selected the USDC stablecoin as their pilot asset, and set about making the infrastructure upgrades necessary to mesh key components of digital currencies with Visa's treasury operations. They've been hard at work over the last several months, working to support a number of key functions: <br/> <br/> * Support reconciliation and currency conversion for stablecoins such as USDC <br/> <br/> * Integrate Visa's treasury systems with Anchorage, as Visa's digital asset settlement agent <br/> <br/> * Support a new Visa settlement report that includes settlement obligations along with public blockchain addresses for account management of crypto wallets and issuers. <br/> <br/> After months of anticipation and careful planning, they completed the first successful settlement transaction this month —with <a href="Crypto.com" target="_blank"> <span class="page-subtitle">Crypto.com</span> </a> sending USDC to Visa's Ethereum address at Anchorage. One small step forward for Visa's settlement platform, one giant step forward for the integration of digital and traditional fiat currencies. After further testing and additional conversations with clients, partners and members of the regulatory community, they hope to launch this capability for other partners in the year ahead. We want to be one of those partners.<br/> <br/>  The good news is, since Glow is helping us, and they have expertise in EVM, we feel confident we have a way forward with Visa.</p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle">PayPal</span><br/> LONDON (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc will announce later on Tuesday that it has started allowing U.S. consumers to use their cryptocurrency holdings to pay at millions of its online merchants globally, a move that could significantly boost use of digital assets in everyday commerce. - Mar 30, 2021 </p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle">Venmo</span><br/> March 22, 2021: At this moment, 2 platforms accept Venmo: Localbitcoin(dot)com and Paxful(dot)com. Choose a broker, and open an account. From there you can use Venmo to purchase Bitcoin. </p>
                     <p class="page-plain-text"><span class="page-subtitle">GUIDING QUESTIONS</span><br/><span class="page-subtitle-darker">What are the the tools that we need to prioritize first</span><br/> Our model centers on a NFT Framework of composable parts that continue to add functionality and ease the developer and user experience. Weighing that against the development cycles required to produce the components, this project fills a large gap in a short period of time. Payments are a core infrastructure need any developer can tell you so.<br/> <br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">How do we attract developers from outside of our current community to participate in Catalyst?</span> <br/>  Creating integrations that are useable across chains and ecosystems is one way, and this is thought through with this proposal. Making payments as easy as connecting one line of code is the holy grail of development.<br/> <br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">What do developers want, and how do they get it from the Cardano dev ecosystem?</span> <br/>  Developers want tools and approaches that make their lives simpler. They also want clear documentation to ensure they can implement new things without too much trouble. They also want things to work they way they are intended. This EZ-Pay API will deliver exactly what developers want. It will start small and grow over time with extensions.<br/> <br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker"> What would make a developer motivated to grind through the docs and code no matter how hard it is to create an app?</span> <br/> It has to be well worth the trouble. So rather than fight that, we aim to make it easier, faster and more fun with the EZ-Pay API. <br/> <br/> <span class="page-subtitle-darker">What are enterprise dev managers looking for in order to be able to build out enterprise projects - either internal or commercial?</span><br/>   Wether internal or commercial, the enterprise has a high standard of security, compliance, documentation, support, packaging and dev/ops. APIs are a standard in enterprise solutions. Good documentation is a must. We plan to deliver both. Building with the MuKn Glow team will offer us the quality of code required by the enterprise.</p>

                              Community Members n+1, is passionate about NFTs and has aligned themselves to a previous proposal seeking funding for a NFT point solution. They are eager to build their business model on top of a solid framework. Since none has existed for Cardano, they were planning to build one for themselves from scratch. They are one of ~300 individuals who could potentially pool their expertise into an all-embracing open-source version to benefit the entire community rather than one project. Their expertise is multivariate in development, SPO, marketing, design, business, and more.
