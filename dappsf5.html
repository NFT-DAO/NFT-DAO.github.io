                    <p class="page-plain-text-but-lighter">
                        Interoperability, scarcity and ownership don't exist on the internet, nor in traditional ticketing. Non-fungible tokens will shake up the ticketing industry and rival traditional companies like Eventbrite.
                    </p>
                    <p class="page-subtitle">Costs</p>
                    <p class="page-plain-text-but-lighter">
                        Event organizers don't have it easy nowadays. They face high upfront costs as well as high risks such as terrorist threats, natural disasters or counterfeiting tickets. On top of that, promoters have to wait until ticketing companies payout ticket sales after the event has finished. Companies like Eventbrite take a high percentage of every ticket sold, which is usually between 2 and 3.5% on every sale, in addition to a set fee. What ticketing companies give in return is a digital ticket sales solution, marketing and sometimes – hardware scanners.

                        Another major issue is that tickets are sold on secondary markets for a much higher price and it is difficult to control who is buying, selling, or redeeming a ticket. On average, 12% of people buying concert tickets get scammed*. In short, the whole ticket sales cycle is a mess.

                    <p class="page-plain-text-but-lighter">
                        NFTs can add great value to ticketing companies and change conventional ticketing to smart ticketing. With NFTs, smart tickets are verifiable, interoperable and have clear ownership. A ticket does not die after being redeemed at an event but, lives on in digital wallets of the user's choice.

                    <p class="page-plain-text-but-lighter">
                        The costs associated with building and minting non-fungible tokens is negligible, especially compared to traditional ticketing infrastructure. Structured correctly, hundreds or even thousands of NFTs (smart tickets) could be created for less than a couple of dollars. Not only do tickets cost less to produce, but they are also unforgeable – the event organizers can easily, quickly, and without a question validate the authenticity and history of ownership.

                    </p>
                    <p class="page-plain-text-but-lighter">
                        This is where the blockchain truly shines. Where re-sale is acceptable, using non-fungible tokens built on top of blockchain technology enables an end-user to verify and validate the authenticity of the ticket with absolute certainty.
                        Where scalping/resale of an event's ticket is strictly forbidden, and the event organizers can enforce this without error. NFTs can be made non-transferrable in computer code and prevent the transfer of tickets.

                        ++What are the key applications that underpin the application ecosystem on other platforms?++There are a few DApps that have wide adoption on other platforms. On is NFTs and marketplaces. This is a specific storefront for selling event and other ticket types that in themselves can become collectables.
                        <br/><br/>
                        ++What are the most profitable or most used applications on other ecosystems?++Clearly DEX and DeFi solutions are at the headwaters of the money stream and therefore the most profitable. Next to DeFi and related is the NFT market, not just art, but NFT solutions of all types will generate trillions in capital in the next decade.
                        </p>

                     <p class="page-plain-text-but-lighter">

                    They need a wide range of DApps similar to other blockchains.
                    <br/><br/>
                    ++What applications deliver the highest amount of value with the least amount of technical sophistication?++The uses for tickets offers possibilities to create decentralized versions of things like EventBrite, not particularly highly technical, more utilitarian, but with a high revenue and volume potential.

                        Community Members n+1, is passionate about NFTs and has aligned themselves to a previous proposal seeking funding for a NFT point solution. They are eager to build their business model on top of a solid framework. Since none has existed for Cardano, they were planning to build one for themselves from scratch. They are one of ~300 individuals who could potentially pool their expertise into an all-embracing open-source version to benefit the entire community rather than one project. Their expertise is multivariate in development, SPO, marketing, design, business, and more.
